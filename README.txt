This project has four main objectives: Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set. 

Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement 
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set 
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The R script titled run_analysis.R accomplishes this with 70 lines of code
